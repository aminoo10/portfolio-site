      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <img src="/images/me.jpg" alt="me by a christmas tree" title="me by a christmas tree"/>
      <p>I  graduated with a degree in <strong><i>Computer Science and Systems</i></strong> 
      from the <i>University of Washington Tacoma</i>. During the COVID-19 Pandemic, 
      I got a certificate from the same school for 
      <strong><i>FRONT-END DEVELOPMENT WITH HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT</i></strong>. <br/><br/>
      In between jobs I've worked in freelance art, and currently am working as a Deployment Lead contractor for TD Bank<br/><br/> In my free time I continue to work towards my goals of 
      working as a software engineer, focusing my efforts with front-end development projects, and all things web!<br/><br/>
      
      I enjoy drawing as a hobby, 
      collaborating with friends on a game development project, and am passionate about all things 
      creative including movies, TV, animation, and video games!</p>
