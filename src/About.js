      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <img src="/images/me.jpg" alt="me by a christmas tree" title="me by a christmas tree"/>
      <p>I  graduated with a degree in <strong><i>Computer Science and Systems</i></strong> from the <i>University of Washington Tacoma</i> in 2017. 
      During the COVID-19 Pandemic, I got a certificate from the same school for <strong><i>FRONT-END DEVELOPMENT WITH HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT</i></strong>. 
      <br/><br/>In between jobs I've worked in freelance art, and currently am studying to learn more about Front-End Development, Android Development, and Design<br/><br/> 
      In my free time I enjoy drawing as a hobby and have interests in animation, cartoons, comics, and movies. I also like video games too and often am brainstorming video game concepts together with a few of my friends.</p>
